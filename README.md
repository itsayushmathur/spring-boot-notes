# 🌱 Spring Boot 3 Notes

---

## 📦 What is Maven?

Maven is a **Project Management Tool** primarily used for:

- **Build Management**: Compiling, packaging, and deploying your code.
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically downloading and resolving library versions.

---

## 🏗 Maven Project Structure

A typical Maven project in Spring Boot follows this structure:

## Project Structure
```
project-root/
│
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/        # Java source code
│   │   ├── resources/   # Application properties & configuration
│   │   └── webapp/      # JSPs, web config, and static assets (css, js, images)
│   │
│   └── test/            # Unit tests and test configuration
│
└── target/              # Compiled code output (auto-generated by Maven)
```

## 🌼 Spring Boot Overview

Spring Boot is **not** a replacement for the Spring Framework. Instead, it's a rapid development toolset built on top of the Spring ecosystem.

### ❓ Does Spring Boot run faster than regular Spring?

> **No**. It uses the same Spring Framework under the hood. The benefit lies in ease of setup and auto-configuration.

### ✅ What does Spring Boot do?

- Simplifies Spring development setup
- Performs **auto-configuration** based on project properties and dependencies
- Minimizes boilerplate/manual configuration
- Resolves **dependency conflicts** more easily
- Provides **embedded HTTP servers** like:
    - **Tomcat**
    - **Jetty**
    - **Undertow**

### 🚀 Deploying Spring Boot Apps

Spring Boot applications can be deployed in traditional ways:

- Create a **WAR** (Web Application Archive)
- Deploy to external servers like **Tomcat**, **JBoss**, or **WebSphere**

---

## 🌱 Spring Projects Ecosystem

Spring Boot supports multiple sub-projects that enhance specific areas of development. Use only what you need:

- **Spring Cloud** – Distributed systems & microservices
- **Spring Data** – Database access & ORM
- **Spring Security** – Authentication & Authorization
- **Spring Batch** – Batch processing
- **Spring Web Services** – SOAP-based services
- **Spring LDAP** – Lightweight Directory Access Protocol support

...and many more.

## 🧩 POM.xml – Project Coordinates

Each Maven project is defined by a set of unique coordinates in its `pom.xml`:

- **Group ID**  
  Represents the organization or group developing the project.  
  _Convention_: Use reverse domain notation.  
  **Example**: `com.itsayushmathur`

- **Artifact ID**  
  The name of the project.  
  **Example**: `springboot-quickstart`

- **Version**  
  The current release version of the project.  
  **Examples**: `1.0`, `1.6`, `2.0`  
  For active development use: `1.0-SNAPSHOT`

---
## 🧰 Maven Wrapper Files

The Maven Wrapper lets you run a Maven project **without having Maven installed** or available in your system `PATH`.  
If the required Maven version is **not present**, it will:

- **Download** the correct version automatically
- **Execute** Maven with that version

Two wrapper scripts are included:

- **`mvnw.cmd`** — for **Windows**
- **`mvnw.sh`** — for **Linux/MacOS**

## 📌 Summary

| Feature       | Spring Boot Advantage                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Setup Time    | Minimal; comes with sensible defaults             |
| Configuration | Auto-configured via properties and classpath      |
| Server        | Embedded (Tomcat/Jetty/Undertow)                  |
| Deployment    | WAR/JAR; Traditional or standalone                |
| Integration   | Works seamlessly with existing Spring ecosystem   |

## 📊 Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator **exposes endpoints** that help you **monitor and manage** your application.

- Provides DevOps functionality **out of the box**
- Just add the dependency to your `pom.xml`
- REST endpoints are **automatically added** to your application

---
## 🔍 Common Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints

Below is a list of commonly used Spring Boot Actuator endpoints and their descriptions:

| Endpoint           | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/actuator`        | Lists all available actuator endpoints                                      |
| `/actuator/health` | Shows application health status (can include disk, DB, etc.)                |
| `/actuator/info`   | Displays custom application info (from `application.properties`)            |
| `/actuator/metrics`| Shows available metrics (memory, GC, CPU, etc.)                             |
| `/actuator/beans`  | Lists all Spring beans in the application context                           |
| `/actuator/env`    | Displays current environment properties and config values                   |
| `/actuator/mappings`| Shows all `@RequestMapping` paths in the app                               |
| `/actuator/loggers`| View and modify logger levels at runtime                                    |
| `/actuator/threaddump` | Returns a thread dump from the running JVM                             |
| `/actuator/httptrace` | Shows last few HTTP request-response traces                              |

> ⚠️ Note: Some endpoints may require enabling explicitly in `application.properties` or setting management roles for access.
